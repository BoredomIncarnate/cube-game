This project was initially based on this tutorial, I used it for basic structure, but is outdated in what system links to make, but still a good tutorial. 

### LazyFoo Tutuorials: [link](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/)

This tuturial series is a life saver, though it is written in c++. Nevertheless, it is a great starting point; I can't recommend this enough.
